## Project Notes

github-actions repository semantic-release implementation complete:

**What Was Built:**
1. semantic-release.yml - Modular reusable workflow (322 lines)
   - Replaces uplift.yml
   - Uses go-semantic-release/action@v1
   - Native feat! support
   - Creates tags + releases in one step
   - GitHub App authentication built-in
   - Comprehensive outputs

2. ci-cd-unified.yml - Unified all-in-one workflow (274 lines)
   - Combines lint → test → semantic-release
   - Calls individual workflows as building blocks
   - Configurable stages
   - Pipeline summary generation

3. Updated ci.yml - Simplified from 3 stages to 2
   - lint → release (no separate version + release jobs)
   - Updated output references
   - Uses new semantic-release.yml workflow

4. test-new-workflows.yml - Manual test workflow (86 lines)
   - workflow_dispatch to test both new workflows
   - Won't work until on main branch (GitHub limitation)

**Configuration:**
- .semrelrc includes both main and research branch
- Configured for GitHub provider
- Default plugins for commit-analyzer, changelog-generator

**Testing Status:**
- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Dry-run testing on research branch successful
- ✅ Commit type detection working (feat! → minor bump in 0.x.x)
- ✅ Changelog generation working
- 🔄 Full integration testing pending (requires merge to main)

**Documentation Created:**
- docs/plans/2026-01-22-semantic-release-comparison.md (not committed)
- docs/plans/gitlab-ci-semantic-release-template.yml (not committed)
- docs/plans/2026-01-23-semantic-release-implementation.md (not committed)

**Migration Path:**
Replace uplift.yml call with semantic-release.yml call, update output names, remove separate release job if using semantic-release.yml.

**Gotchas:**
- workflow_call workflows can't be tested with workflow_dispatch from non-default branch
- docs/plans/ is in .gitignore (intentional, local-only docs)
- feat! bumps minor in 0.x.x, major at ≥1.0.0 (semver spec)
- GitHub App required for downstream workflow triggers

**Next Step:**
Create PR to merge research branch to main, then validate full pipeline works in production.
